    <h1>Entrepreneurship</h1>
    <p>Does CynergisED have the potential to become a company? Through discussions and business plans, we postulated how CynergisED could address underexplored areas in relevant markets by learning from experts in various fields. Pitching our novel concept idea to investors, sponsors, enterprise executives and patent managers helped form our postulated business plans – while also planning further steps we would take to progress our potential commercialisation.</p>

    <h2>1. Company Description</h2>
    <p>To supplement our biological solar panel, we have also developed a potential solution for internal recycling of the residual waste product from the energy production stage in the panel system to reduce potential waste while combating the current decline in pollinator populations [<sup>2</sup>]. This decline could be caused by a lower land cover as well as a decline in pollen quality and supply due to climate change [<sup>3</sup>]. The principle aims of such a solution being to mitigate the impact of solar panels on ecological land use and the environment in general. Essentially, this recycling system, which incorporates circular economy principles during construction, may provide a food source for pollinators – potentially reversing the detrimental effects to pollinators created by urbanisation, promoting biodiversity in urban areas where the use of our solar panels could be implemented. On a larger scale, this system could act as a bioreactor for a sustainable generation of a pollen substitute diet for pollinators.</p>

    <h2>2. General Business Plan</h2>
    <p>Following a Canva Business Model, CynergisED aims to follow the key activities outlined below:</p>
    <ul>

    <h2>3. Marketing Plan</h2>
<p>The main objective behind CynergisED's marketing plan is to introduce a novel concept idea of a biological solar panel that could benefit the ecosystem rather than harm it. Our selling points regard how we aim to improve solar panels that are currently in use while meeting seven of the sustainable development goals. The audience of our marketing efforts would be companies in similar industries for potential partnerships, beekeepers, governmental institutions, and individual end-users interested in sustainable solutions in their households to re-balance the effects on our planet caused by climate change. CynergisED fits in with Maslow’s hierarchy of needs at both the top and bottom of the pyramid as a basic need necessary for human and economic development, while also being a luxury choosing a greener alternative to conventional solar panels. By being primarily a basic need, CynergisED provides a crucial product for human needs.</p>

<p>You might be asking, what's the difference between the solar panels being used today and what we're trying to develop?</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        <p>A vast majority (95%) of current solar panels use silicon as a semiconductor.</p>
        <p>However, mining transporting, and processing of the raw material is extremely energy and labor-intensive. Temperatures of up to 2000 degrees Celsius are required to purify the silicon, and for every 50,000 tons produced, 500,000 tons of carbon dioxide gas are released into the atmosphere [4].</p>
        <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> While precious metals do not grow on trees, bacteria do! We aim to replace the silicon in solar panels with cyanobacteria. In doing so, we provide a renewable material that is less labor-intensive to produce and much more carbon-friendly. We are also engineering the cyanobacteria for carbon capture so that we can achieve a carbon-negative solar panel.</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Solar cells require plenty of space, often necessitating the destruction of fields for large-scale installations, incurring a heavy ecological burden to their surroundings [5].</p>
        <p><strong>Our solution:</strong> Bacterial-driven panels can co-exist with their ecosystem, minimizing ecological disruption. Furthermore, we have modified the bacteria to produce "pollen-like" particles that would provide feed for pollinators.</p>
    </li>
</ol>

<p>We are different from our competitors because:</p>

<ul>
    <li>CynergisED could accelerate the Energy Transition while incorporating circular economy principles during construction.</li>
    <li>Energy production from solar panels at larger solar farms crowd up wildlife and can damage their habitats. CynergisED is rethinking a way to encourage biodiversity while also generating electricity, even in urban areas, that can benefit the ecosystem rather than harm it.</li>
    <li>Our solar panels can be used in households to power equipment requiring a small-scale electricity generation, such as lights, while also benefiting the local pollinator populations - implementing a start to a more sustainable shift in solar panel designs.</li>
</ul>

<p>Our Unique Selling Propositions (USPs) would be central in further marketing strategies. CynergisED has been featured in the local newspaper Edinburgh Reporter, and we aim to expand our reach on social media platforms and other media outlets. We would also like to continue our marketing efforts through showcasing our project at conferences, pitching sessions provided by Edinburgh Innovations, and through networking with similar companies in the industry.</p>

    <h2>Figure 2: Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats (SWOT)</h2>
<p> CynergisED addresses underdeveloped areas within the realm of solar energy, with novel solutions to improve solar panel designs. The Circular Economy initiative, focusing on recycling waste products to benefit the ecosystem, stands out as a significant strength. This novel concept addresses two pressing global issues simultaneously, demonstrating a commitment to sustainability and innovation. However, there are notable weaknesses to consider. The high production cost poses a challenge, and the lower energy efficiency levels compared to standard solar panels may limit its adoption. Additionally, regular maintenance by end-users, such as refilling growth media, adds to the operational burden.</p>

<p>On the bright side, there are various opportunities on the horizon for CynergisED. The project opens doors to several partnering opportunities, and there's room for growth on a larger scale, with the potential for solar farms and the production of the pollen substitute diet at larger scales in bioreactors. A possible solution to the aforementioned problem of maintenance could be solved through partnerships with biotechnology companies providing the growth media at accessible locations for end-users, such as petrol stations or various supermarket or relevant utility stores.</p>

<p>Nonetheless, there are threats to navigate, including high competition from non-biological standard solar panel companies such as SMA Solar Technology, an uncertain economic environment, and the possibility of environmental conditions affecting panel productivity. Moreover, further testing is essential to ensure the safety of the pollen substitute diet for pollinators, highlighting the need for ongoing research and development efforts following the Grand Jamboree.</p>

<h2>7. Conclusions</h2>
<p>The business development work started for CynergisED acts as a foundation for a further assessment into the potential success of commercializing such a venture. By following the further steps postulated in fig. 1, CynergisED has the potential to grow and expand in real-world settings – making a critical impact into the field of solar energy and in restoring bee populations.</p>
